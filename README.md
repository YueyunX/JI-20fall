Some general suggestions:
* Try to attend every lecture and stay awake. Focus on general ideas rather than technical tricks. 
* Try to complete every exercise in the assignments on your own first. 
* Review the lecture slides on a regular basis. 
* Attend recitation classes(RC) for a recap. Also it is recommended to come to office hour(OH) if there is any question.
