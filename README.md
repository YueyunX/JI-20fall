Some general suggestions:
1. Try to attend every lecture and stay awake. Focus on general ideas rather than technical tricks. 
2. Complete every exercise in the assignments on your own first. 
3. Review the lecture slides on a regular basis. 
4. Attend recitation classes(RC) for a recap. Also it is recommended to come to office hour(OH) if there is any question. 
5. Learn well and have fun.
